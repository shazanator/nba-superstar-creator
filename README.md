🏀 NBA Frankenstein: Build Your Own GOAT 🧟♂️
Tired of the MJ vs. LeBron debates? Create your own abomination! Mix MJ’s scoring with Shaq’s free throws and Westbrook’s shot selection—then pray your monstrosity doesn’t get sent to the G League.

🔥 How It Works:
Get 6 random NBA legends (Hope you don’t pull Kwame Brown).

Pick skills like a buffet (Kobe’s scoring + Draymond’s temper = unstoppable?).

Name your creation ("LeBronto Raptor" or "Air Bagel" accepted).

Get roasted (95+ = "GOAT! 🐐", <75 = "Washed like 2011 LeBron in the Finals").

Warning: Side effects may include Charles Barkley laughing at you on Inside the NBA.
